# 📖 Test-Driven-Development <a name="about-project"></a>

> **Test Driven Development** is a software development approach that emphasizes writing tests for a piece of code before actually implementing that code. The primary goal of TDD is to ensure that software functions correctly and meets the desired requirements by following a structured and iterative process.<br>
> **Steps:**
> - **Write a Test**: *Before writing any code, the developer writes a test case that defines the expected behavior of a specific piece of functionality. This test is usually written in a testing framework specific to the programming language being used.*
> - **Run the Test**: *Initially, the test will fail since the code to be tested doesn't exist yet, or it doesn't implement the desired functionality.*
> - **Write the Code**: *The developer then proceeds to write the minimum amount of code necessary to make the test pass. This code should fulfill the requirements outlined in the test case.*
> - **Run the Test Again**: *After writing the code, the developer runs the test again. If the test now passes, it means that the code meets the specified requirements and hasn't introduced any regressions.*
> - **Refactor** *(if necessary)*: *If the code passes the test but could be improved in terms of readability, efficiency, or maintainability, the developer can refactor it while keeping the test in a passing state. This ensures that any changes don't break the existing functionality.*
